                            <div class="block d-flex col">

                                <h2 class="subtitle">If your pup’s intermittent paw licking has you confused, 
                                    then this article is a must-read. 
                                    You’ll learn the TRUTH about this troublesome behavior, 
                                    plus how to help.
                                </h2>

                                <p>Now, common sense would suggest that paw licking is just a surface issue, 
                                    but oftentimes, the real cause can be found deep,
                                     deep down inside your dog’s body - in the form of a disrupted gut.
                                </p>

                                <p>You see, when a dog's gut is overwhelmed with bad bacteria and yeast overproduction, 
                                    it can lead to a hyperactive immune system and some inflammation.
                                </p>

                                <p>In simple terms, this means your dog is PRIMED for skin discomfort. 
                                    With heightened sensitivity to the smallest allergen in the air, <strong>especially in delicate areas like paws and ears.</strong>
                                </p>

                                <p>Your pup’s <strong>paw licking is simply their way of desperately trying to find comfort.</strong></p>

                                <p>Luckily though, <strong>a remarkable new probiotic chew</strong> has just hit the market that many are calling the 
                                    "must-have product for every dog paw licking or dealing with seasonal allergies.” 
                                    And it may be just the ticket to help your pup live a happy, comfortable life.</p>

                                    Below are some of Probiotic chews game changing benefits that make it an absolute no brainer for dog parents.

                                <p>Many of your dog's issues are a reaction to something more worrying deep down in their gut: <strong>disruptive bacteria and yeast.</strong></p>

                                <p>This disruption can be caused by environmental factors or poor diet but if the ’bad bacteria’ is left unattended, it can cause havoc on their immune system.</p>

                                <p>Recent studies1 show a dog's gut makeup and balance of good and bad bacteria impact its immune system. So, you can probably see why balancing their gut bacteria is important.</p>
                                
                                <p>Fortunately, probiotic chews are filled with <strong>3 billion “units” of good bacteria!</strong> This good bacteria enters a dog's stomach and re-balances the overall bacteria makeup in their digestive system.</p>

                                <p>Seasonal allergies can fast turn a pup from fun, bright, and peppy to itchy, stressed, and uncomfortable.</strong></p>

                                <p>Maybe you’ve tried countless remedies to conquer your dog’s allergies, only for them to return year after year...</p>

                                <p>However, the <strong>real reason</strong> you’ve never managed to ensure long-lasting comfort for your pup is that you’ve likely never tackled the root cause of their seasonal allergies.</p>

                                <p>And as surprising as it might seem, allergies often originate from <strong>poor gut health</strong>. Now, you already know poor gut health can impact a dog’s immune system…</p>

                                <p>And that’s just another reason why probiotic chews are so great. By helping restore your dog’s gut bacteria, they assist with a healthy immune system..</p>

                                <p>And that’s the real key to weathering seasonal or environmental allergies!</p>

                                <img src="uploads\images\Anxiety dog 1.png" alt="petsy lab">

                                <p>Dogs get environmental stress just like us 
                                    humans and stress levels can seriously affect their mental well-being. 
                                    Especially if they’re part of big families that are loud, own multiple 
                                    pets and put them in kennels when travelling.</p>

                                <p>This stress affects the digestive tract and impacts their mood
                                     - and if your dog is challenged by occasional stress due to 
                                     travelling or environmental changes, or perhaps events like 
                                     fireworks, then studies2 have shown that…</p>

                                <p>Probiotics could help a great deal.</p>

                                <p>AKC also recommends giving your dog probiotics 
                                    a few days before you know they’re about to go 
                                    through something potentially stressful3. For example, 
                                    around fireworks, moving or seeing the vet</p>

                                <p>Plus, some dogs get stressed easier than others. 
                                    If that’s the case for your pooch, 
                                    then a daily dose of probiotics will help support everyday 
                                    situations like going on car rides or being left 
                                    alone while you’re at work.</p>

                                    a magic pill to cure infections or serious skin problems. 
                                    If this is the case for your dog then it's likely they need to see a vet.</p>

                                    support and maintain healthy skin and overall wellness of your pup-this probiotic supplement chew is a MUST.</p>
